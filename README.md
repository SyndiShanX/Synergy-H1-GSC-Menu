# Synergy H1 GSC Menu

GSC Mod Menu that uses [H1-Mod](https://github.com/auroramod/h1-mod)

This Menu is a Work-In-Progress, so expect changes and possibly some Bugs

If you use any Code from my Menu, your Menu also has to be Open-Source as per the [GNU GPLv3 License](https://github.com/SyndiShanX/Synergy-IW-GSC-Menu/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

If you have any Issues/Suggestions, please Submit them in [Issues](https://github.com/SyndiShanX/Synergy-IW-GSC-Menu/issues)

### Requirements: [H1-Mod](https://github.com/auroramod/h1-mod)

* Download [Synergy.gsc](https://syndishanx.github.io/Synergy-H1-GSC-Menu/Synergy.gsc)

* Place it into `h1-mod/scripts/mp`

* Open `Synergy.gsc` with a Text Editor and Replace `Username` on Line 5 with your Username

* You have to play with other Players or Bots, so the best option is to play in a Private Match with Bots Enabled
